# Dog-Breed-Classification
- For your dog breed classifier project, hereâ€™s a possible project description and steps

## Project Description:
- "I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based dog breed classifier using TensorFlow and Keras. The model was trained on an image dataset, achieving a validation accuracy of 98.97%. The project involved loading, resizing, and normalizing images, followed by creating a multi-class classification model. I implemented layers of convolution, max-pooling, and dense layers with dropout for regularization. After training, I saved the model for future deployment."

#### Steps:
### Data Preparation:

- Loaded and preprocessed the dataset of dog breed images.
- Resized images to a standard shape (150x150) and normalized pixel values.
- Encoded categorical labels using LabelEncoder and converted them into one-hot vectors.
  
### Model Architecture:

- Defined a CNN with multiple convolutional layers (32, 64, 128 filters), max-pooling layers, and a dense fully connected layer.
- Added dropout layers to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
- Used the softmax activation in the output layer for multi-class classification.
  
### Model Compilation:

- Compiled the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy as the loss function.
- Monitored accuracy during training.
  
### Training :

- Split the dataset into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets.
- Trained the model for 30 epochs with a batch size of 32.
  

### Evaluation:

"I used categorical_crossentropy as the loss function because the problem is multi-class classification. After training for 30 epochs, the model achieved an accuracy of 98.97% on the validation set, showing that it can generalize well."

### Challenges and Solutions:

"Initially, I noticed some overfitting, so I added dropout layers and reduced the learning rate. This improved validation performance significantly."

### Final Output:

"The final model was saved as dog_breed_classifier_model.h5 and can be loaded for inference. This model can classify 10 different dog breeds with high accuracy."
